## Laboratory Rules

*   Laboratory work takes place exclusively in the laboratory rooms (ED218 and ED217).
    
*   Work is done individually or within a maximum of 2 students per development board, if the number of boards is not sufficient for 1 board - 1 student; it is recommended that one computer be used for code development and one for consulting documentation or laboratory support.
    
*   Students from other years, who are repeating the laboratory, can come at any time slot, within the limit of available places.
    
*   The choice of laboratory interval can be made until the end of the second week, after which no further changes can be made.
    
*   Labs can only be made up within the same week in any of the semi-groups, within the limit of available places. Labs submitted/presented later will not be scored.
    
*   Late arrivals of more than 15 minutes after the start of the lab are not accepted.

----

*   In the project labs, parts will be glued together and projects will be discussed. You are NOT allowed to be absent.
    
*   Schematics and other project-related materials will be presented on the respective project's wiki page/github page.
    
*   Project milestones are presented in the laboratory
  


## Final Laboratory Test (Colloquium) Rules

*   Grid test on Moodle
    
*   All material covered in the lab will be taught during the week of April 28th - May 2rd.
    
*   Duration: TBD
    
*   You are allowed to use documentation (datasheet, laboratory support, Internet).
    
*   You are not allowed to access collaborative web resources (including ChatGPT, Bard, etc.), or use any communication tools, to collaborate with other colleagues. Those who violate this rule will receive a zero grade.
