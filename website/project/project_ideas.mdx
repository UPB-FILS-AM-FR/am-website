Before you chose what you want you want to do, it might be helpful if you think about the following questions:

- Do you find it **useful** or **fun**?
- What is the **level of complexity** of your project? How many hours do you estimate to work on it? (It should be around **40 hours**)
- What things can you **learn** from making this project?
