*   minimum 2.5 points out of 5 for entrance to the exam
    
    

### Project rating

The activity in project classes (weeks 9-14) will revolve around milestones, moments when you will have to present the intermediate stage of the project to your project assistant.

The score associated with the project is calculated according to the table below.

| Milestone | Criterion | Score (hardware-heavy) | Scoring (software-heavy) | Scoring (balanced) | Scoring condition | Deadline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1. Documentation | Wiki content | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.4 | according to the list of minimum requirements | week 10 |
| M2. Hardware | Hardware implementation | 0.9 | 0.7 | 0.8 | according to the list of minimum requirements | week 12 |
| M3. Software | Software implementation | 0.7 | 0.9 | 0.8 | according to the list of minimum requirements | week 13 |
| PM Fair | Presentation and documentation | 1   | 1   | 1   | participation in PM Fair | week 14 (May 29) |
| Bonus | Top 15 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | The first 15 projects\* in the 3 series receive a bonus |     |
| Top 5 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | The first 5 projects\* in the 3 series receive an additional bonus |     |


(\*) Winning projects (there will be prizes) will be chosen by the PM team based on merit

Projects will be classified from the beginning, in consultation with the project assistant, into one of the categories: hardware-heavy, software-heavy, balanced.



The choice of project topic is made through discussions with the project assistant, who **must give his/her consent for the topic you have chosen** . Following the discussions, the assistant will approve your topic.


## Project Rules

*   Attendance is not scored in project labs, they are intended for discussions and project work, but failure to show up for at least 3 (fewer if there was an official day off on the day of the project lab) of these meetings may result in the project not being scored.
    
*   Students can come to other project classes for advice/questions/help, not for grading (within the time/space available)
    
*   The project is presented at the end of the semester for grading. The project is presented during the PM Fair event.
    
*   The hardware part of the project can also be implemented using breadboards
    
    *   In this case, the hardware part must be fully functional to receive the score associated with it, otherwise 0 is awarded.
        
*   Projects copied or completed by another person will result in the cancellation of the semester's score, which will require repeating the subject.
    
*  The project is individual.
    

**The M1** and **PM Fair** milestones will have an associated assignment on github where you will need to upload a relevant file (information will be found in each assignment). For PM Fair it is absolutely necessary that the documentation is uploaded to your own wiki page on the PM course ocw.
